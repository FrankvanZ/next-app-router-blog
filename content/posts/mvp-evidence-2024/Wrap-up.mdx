# Community mentorship 2024
As the year draws to a close it's that time of year where everyone gathers their contributions from the past year and list them out to see the fruits of their labour.
It's my first time making an attempt to become a Sitecore MVP and it's been a great experience. 
I joined the Sitecore Community mentorship programme and had a blast throughout the year with my mentor and friend Peter Clisby. 
Weekly catch-ups on things I wanted to achieve, combined with the social aspect of catching up has made this mentorship programme a great experience. 
Sadly we didn't get to meet up, but that will hopefully be something we'll manage next year.
Peter, thanks for being a sparring partner throughout the year and helping me make the most of this year!

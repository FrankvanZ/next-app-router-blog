# Introduction
Connecting the Sitecore XM Cloud Pages used to be possible but a bit of a hassle. 
[Jean-François L'Heureux's blogpost](https://www.jflh.ca/2023-11-21-introducing-sitecore-xm-cloud-extensions) about his written Google Chrome extension really helped the developer experience in that regard.
He automated the procedures needed to connect your local host to Pages in a neat Google Chrome extension. However [JSS 22.1 has been released](https://developers.sitecore.com/changelog/xm-cloud/10092024/a-better-pages-experience-and-simplified-front-end-development) and it's a brave new world for XMC developers!

# What to expect
If you're using Sitecore XM Cloud, be ready to see a new addition to your Pages view:

<Image
  src="/posts/pages_update.png"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Deploying Next.js Apps"
/>

This in and of itself does nothing unless you upgrade your XMC repository to 22.1. 
It's a nice addition improving the developer experience, but also be a gem and warn your content editors that changing anything via this dropdown menu is a developer centric addition and doesn't help them.
For reference if you're not running a JSS 22.1 version of Next.js this will be the experience trying to connect to localhost:

<Image
  src="/posts/pages_update_no_localhost.png"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Deploying Next.js Apps"
/>

## Conclusion
To make use of this new feature introduced to Pages make sure to upgrade your Next.js repository to JSS version 22.1!
